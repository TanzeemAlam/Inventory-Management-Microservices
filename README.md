# Inventory-Management-Microservices

Title: Inventory Management System (Microservices Architecture)

Description:
Developed a scalable Inventory Management backend system using Spring Boot microservices architecture to streamline product tracking, stock updates, and billing operations. The system integrates multiple services such as Product, Inventory, Customer, Billing, and Livestock through API Gateway and Service Discovery (Eureka) for seamless communication and scalability.

Key Responsibilities:

Designed and implemented RESTful microservices for managing products, stock levels, and billing workflows.

Integrated Spring Cloud components like Eureka Server, API Gateway, and Config Server for centralized configuration and service registry.

Utilized Feign Clients for inter-service communication, ensuring low coupling and high cohesion.

Implemented Spring Security with JWT for user authentication and role-based access control.

Integrated MySQL as the data store with JPA/Hibernate for ORM mapping.

Managed asynchronous communication using Kafka/RabbitMQ for event-driven updates between services.

Containerized the microservices using Docker for smooth deployment and scalability.

Deployed on AWS (EC2, RDS) with CI/CD pipelines through Jenkins for automated build and deployment.
